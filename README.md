# Objects-Recognation
In this project, we have added a trained model of four classes (cat, dog, human and car). A 2.5 GB dataset was used, with 10 training times, divided by 85% training, 15% testing. Code entirely in Python on Jupiter. The model used is CNN, which gives a good classification accuracy of about 98%.
